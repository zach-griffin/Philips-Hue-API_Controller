# Philips Hue API Controller
A small PHP app for controlling lights and other Hue devices through the Hue API

This PHP app allows us to tap into the Hue API with a GUI and interact with devices. Feel free to fork and add on as needed.

The app requires a valid Hue API token which can be generated using the process outlined in the API-Setup document.
